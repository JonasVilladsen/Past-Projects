# Past-Projects

This repository includes some of the software developed and used throughout my master's in Mathematical Engineering at Aalborg University. The software is written in Python, and the overall goal is to illustrate some of my previous work.

Currently, the repository includes:
<ul>
  <li> <strong>P7_libraries-master</strong>, which is a sub repository, including the software developed during the 1. semester of my masters. The project revolved around using deep learning to predict the power from solar panels.
  <li> <strong>P8_libraries-master</strong>, which is a sub repository, including some of the software developed during the 2. semester of my masters. The project revolved around sparse channel estimation using iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithms (ISTA).
</ul>
